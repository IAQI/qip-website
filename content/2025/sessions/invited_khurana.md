## Abstract
A flurry of exciting, recent work has shown that the mathematical hardness required to realize cryptosystems such as bit commitments and secure computation in a quantum world can be significantly weaker than the hardness required for classical cryptography. This talk will discuss recent progress and some remaining challenges in understanding the assumptions that enable cryptography in a quantum world.
