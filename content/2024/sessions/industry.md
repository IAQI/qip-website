The session is intended to provide a comprehensive view of the industry landscape for quantum cryptography technologies and services. Organized and chaired by Diego López (Telefónica, leading the QNSP work on commercial services), it is structured around the different layers defining the provisioning of quantum crypto services:

* Quantum device manufacturers, considering the two main QKD technology trends: DV and CV, and featuring:
    * <strong>Jean-Sébastien Pegon </strong>(IDQ)
    * <strong>Vanesa Díaz </strong>(LuxQuanta)
    * <strong>Marco Avesani</strong>(ThinkQuantum)    
* Key management and crypto service provisioning, featuring:
    * <strong>Laura Ortiz </strong>(QoolNet)
* Applications enabled by quantum crypto, featuring:
    * <strong>Christoph Pacher </strong>(fragmentiX)
* The system-wide approach, with focus on current testing (NOSTRADOMUS) and deployment (EuroQCI) initiatices, featuring:
    * <strong>Florian Prawits </strong>(AIT)

Each participant will provide an overview of the status of their respective activities, and will participate in a panel discussion on the industrial landscape and the prospective for it in the coming years.
