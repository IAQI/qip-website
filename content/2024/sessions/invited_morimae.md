## Abstract
The existence of one-way functions is the minimum assumption in classical cryptography. On the other hand, in quantum cryptography where quantum computing and quantum communications are possible, recent studies have demonstrated that the existence of one-way functions is not necessarily the minimum assumption.
Several new fundamental primitives have been introduced, such as pseudorandom unitaries, pseudorandom states, one-way state generators, EFI pairs, and one-way puzzles. They seem to be weaker than one-way functions, but still imply many useful applications, such as secret-key encryption, message authentication codes, digital signatures, private-key quantum money, commitments, and multiparty computations, etc. In this talk, I explain the basics of this “quantum cryptography without one-way functions” and give many open problems that I want to know the answers to.
