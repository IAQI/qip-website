QCrypt 2023 is hosting a special public event that will bring together proponents of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) to compare the advantages and concerns. Open to the public, this timely and important discussion will be of interest across a wide range of audiences including industry, academia, government, and more.

## Bios:
**Scott Fluhrer** is a cryptographer who works for the Security and Trust (STO) Organization within Cisco Systems; he is currently researching (among other things) various approaches to post quantum cryptography. His previous works include breaks on a number of cryptographical primitives, most notably RC4 as used in the Wired Encryption Protocol (WEP) system. In addition, Fluhrer has a master’s in computer engineering from Case Western Reserve University.

**Norbert Lütkenhaus** is the Executive Director of the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) at the University of Waterloo, and a professor in the Faculty of Science. He also leads the Optical Quantum Communication Theory Group at IQC. He began researching quantum information in 1993, earning his PhD from the University of Strathclyde in Scotland, UK. His PhD research built the foundation of the ongoing security analysis of optical implementations of quantum key distribution (QKD), leading to the first complete security analysis of practical QKD. His current research is at the intersection between theoretical quantum protocols and practical realizations, and developing quantum optical versions of protocols that realize quantum communication and information complexity advantages. 

**Ray Perlner** is a member of the Cryptographic Technology Group at NIST, where he has served as a mathematician since 2007. He has been a member of the team organizing the NIST Postquantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization process, since its inception in 2016. He has coauthored cryptanalysis papers on several NIST PQC candidates in the multivariate, rank-based, code-based, and hash-based-signature categories, and helped develop the “support minors modeling” technique, which has played a major role in the subsequent cryptanalysis of rank-based and code-based schemes. In addition to his research and standards activity, Ray is a co-author on the third edition of “Network Security: Private Communication in a Public World” (Pearson 2022). 

**Dr Ramona Wolf** is a postdoctoral researcher at ETH Zurich in the group of Renato Renner. Her research interests lie in the area of quantum cryptography, especially in security proofs for quantum key distribution protocols and their role in larger (quantum) communication networks, as well as quantum random number generation. She obtained her PhD at Leibniz University Hanover, Germany in 2020.
