### Bios
**Dr. Lily (Lidong) Chen** is a mathematician and heads Cryptographic Technology Group in Computer Security Division, NIST. Her team has been developing cryptographic standards published in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) and NIST Special Publications (SP). The team is currently devoted to developing the next generation of cryptography standards, including post-quantum cryptography, lightweight cryptography for constrained environments, and approaches many advanced cryptographic areas.

**Mr. Hanai** joined Toshiba Corporation in 1987. He started his career as software designer of telecommunication systems in Toshiba’s Information and Communication Systems Laboratory. Then he joined undersea optical cable systems project with AT&T, British Telecom and France Telecom. In Toshiba, he has been engaged in system design, IT consulting, business development, technical marketing in emerging technology - including Deep Learning and Quantum Technology. Currently he leads Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) business unit in Toshiba. From 2021, he also worked as a chair of Quantum Cryptography and Quantum Communication subcommittee in Quantum Strategic industry Alliance for Revolution (Q-STAR), a Japanese quantum industry consortium.
He holds BA in Electric Engineering from Aoyamagakuin University and MS in Computer Science from George Washington University.

**Mr. McClelland** has worked in the quantum, energy, healthcare, cybersecurity and computer science industries with over 30 years of industry experience. He worked at Science Applications International Corporation and San Diego Gas and Electric.  Corey is currently working with Qubitekk where they design, build, and integrate the hardware and software for quantum networks, precursors to the quantum-enabled internet while championing the growth of a robust quantum ecosystem through education, advocacy and collaboration.
Active in philanthropy, Corey is the founder, and Chairman Emeritus of the Prevent Drowning Foundation of San Diego formally the San Diego Junior Lifeguard Foundation.  He holds a BA from San Diego State University in Clinical Psychology and an MS in Computer Science from West Coast University.

After a Master in Physics and a Master in Telecom, **Jean-Sébastien Pegon** started his career at NIST as a guest researcher in Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) 20 years ago. Back in Europe, he worked in two startup’s developing wireless internet access, fix and mobile services for Swiss enterprises. Then he joined Orange Business Services as a product manager to develop and launch a worldwide digital voice service (SIP Trunking) for Multinational companies, before moving to the business development team promoting digital collaboration solutions, managing the European and Indirect markets. Jean-Sébastien joined ID Quantique in 2018, participating in business development in the Quantum Security division, which develops next-generation Quantum-Safe solutions, and especially quantum key distribution systems. These systems are designed to be safe against the power of quantum computers, which threaten the conventional encryption methods. As Head of telecom and finance market, he addresses Cloud and Telecom service providers to convince them that Quantum Security is a fast moving and key topic in a world driven by the value of our Data.
