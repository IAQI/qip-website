| July 19, 2023 | <strong>Parking and Construction Updates</strong>: Significant construction is taking place on the UMD campus due to the Purple Line, a new light rail that will extend from New Carrollton in Prince George‚Äôs County to Silver Spring and Bethesda in Montgomery County. Therefore, parking is unavailable for visitors on campus, and pedestrian detours are likely. The closest parking lot is diagonally across the street from the Iribe Center next to The Hotel, available via <strong><a href="https://www.offcampusparking.com/collegepark">the parking app SpotHero.</a></strong><br><br>Typically, the university is accessible via the College Park/U of MD station on the <a href="https://www.wmata.com/">Washington Metro</a> system's Green Line. <strong>However, parts of the Green Line serving College Park will be closed during QCrypt due to ongoing maintenance</strong>. Buses are provided at closed stations in lieu of the Metro trains, but they are usually overcrowded and inefficient. If you do travel to the College Park/U of MD station by bus, <a href="https://transportation.umd.edu/shuttle-um/104/501">a free UMD shuttle bus #104</a> is available every eight minutes on weekdays between the station and campus. See the <a href="https://2023.qcrypt.net/travel/">travel</a> tab for more information.|
