# DevFest Theme Hugo

The theme is located in the `/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/` subdirectory. It used to be an independent theme, as a separate git submodule, but since 2023, it's permanently included in the git repository.

> [!NOTE]
> The original multi-lingual support has been dropped, but reminders of it are still lingering around.

## Getting ready to edit the theme

First, install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

Then, use
```
cd themes/devfest-theme-hugo
yarn
```
to install the dependencies.

As you might not have the right version of npm, you might have to install the node version manager [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Then, use
```
nvm install 10.0
```

In the same directory, run `npm start` to watch [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) changes.

When you are happy with the result run `npm run build` to build the minified versions of `theme.js` and `theme.css`. Then commit to these.

### Installing on a new ARM Mac
node-sass is not yet ported to ARM processors, but there is a work-around described here:
https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/3033#issuecomment-763180778
TODO: newer software exists now...

### Header

The top navigation bar is build with

* Site title
* Site parameter `logos.header` for the logo, specified per year in [hugo.toml](../../hugo.toml)
* Menu `main`

### Footer

The footer is build with

* Site title
* Site params `email`, `subscriptionUrl`, `logos.footer`, `copyright`
* data from `data/footer.yml`

```yml
share:
  - name: facebook
    url: https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=
  - name: twitter
    url: https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=

follow:
  - name: twitter
    url: https://twitter.com/Qcryptc
  - name: youtube
    url: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClpn9CxuZPHw3nzhdv0m3Hw

content:
  - title: footer_about
    links:
      - nameKey: footer_charter
        name: QCrypt Charter
        url: /charter/
        newTab: false
      - nameKey: footer_history
        name: QCrypt History
        url: /history/
        newTab: false
      - nameKey: footer_coc
        name: QCrypt Code of Conduct
        url: /code-of-conduct/
        newTab: false
```

There are also quite some more options in the original tempalate that we are currently not using.

The `url` in the links of `footer_about` is prepended with the `.Params.currentYear`, so that the footer always point to these documents of the current year.


### Home

The Home page is build with markdown and calling some shortcodes like `jumbo`, `button-link`, `home-info` etc..

#### Jumbo bloc

```hugo
{{% jumbo img="/images/2024/background-2024.jpg" imgLabel="QCrypt 2024 background" logo="/images/2024/QCrypt_2024_logo_final.png" %}}
