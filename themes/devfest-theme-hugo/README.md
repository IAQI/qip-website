# DevFest Theme Hugo

The theme is located in the `/themes/devfest-theme-hugo/` subdirectory. It originated as an [independent theme](https://github.com/GDGToulouse/devfest-theme-hugo), as a separate git submodule, but since 2023, it's permanently included in the git repository.

> [!NOTE]
> The original multi-lingual support has been dropped, but reminders of it are still lingering around.

## Getting ready to edit the theme

First, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download), in particular install `v22.12.0 (LTS)` for `macOS/linux/windows` using `nvm` with `npm`. `nvm` is a cross-platform Node.js version manager. 
> [!WARNING]
> This has only been tested on macOS so far, so sharing your experience with other platforms here is very appreciated!

Make sure you are using the latest `npm` version by
```bash
$ nvm use --lts
Now using node v22.12.0 (npm v10.9.0)
```

Then, in the main `qcrypt-website` folder, run
```bash
$ npm clean-install
```
to install the dependencies as specified in [package.json](/package.json). This will create a `node_modules` subfolder which should not be included in the git repositry (that's why it's excluded in the [.gitignore](/.gitignore)).

This has installed the PostCSS features, so now you should be able to run
```bash
$ hugo build
```
which builds the whole site to the `/public` subfolder, which is also excluded from the git repository. You can always delete this whole folder (`$ rm -rf qcrypt-website/public`) and rebuild it with the command above.

## Theme structure

### Header

The top navigation bar is build with

* Site title
* Site parameter `logos.header` for the logo, specified per year in [hugo.toml](../../hugo.toml)
* Menu `main`

### Footer

The footer is build with

* Site title
* Site params `email`, `subscriptionUrl`, `logos.footer`, `copyright`
* data from `data/footer.yml`

```yml
share:
  - name: facebook
    url: https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=
  - name: twitter
    url: https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=

follow:
  - name: twitter
    url: https://twitter.com/Qcryptc
  - name: youtube
    url: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClpn9CxuZPHw3nzhdv0m3Hw

content:
  - title: footer_about
    links:
      - nameKey: footer_charter
        name: QCrypt Charter
        url: /charter/
        newTab: false
      - nameKey: footer_history
        name: QCrypt History
        url: /history/
        newTab: false
      - nameKey: footer_coc
        name: QCrypt Code of Conduct
        url: /code-of-conduct/
        newTab: false
```

There are also quite some more options in the original tempalate that we are currently not using.

The `url` in the links of `footer_about` is prepended with the `.Params.currentYear`, so that the footer always point to these documents of the current year.


### Home

The Home page is build with markdown and calling some shortcodes like `jumbo`, `button-link`, `home-info` etc..

#### Jumbo bloc

```hugo
{{% jumbo img="/images/2024/background-2024.jpg" imgLabel="QCrypt 2024 background" logo="/images/2024/QCrypt_2024_logo_final.png" %}}

### Schedule
Schedule data per year is in `/data/schedule-YEAR.yml`, for example:

```yml
- day: '2024-09-02'
  sessions:
    - session: __checkin
      time: '08:30'
    - session: __welcomingremarks
      time: '09:00'
    - session: tutorial_tavakoli
      time: '09:15'
    - session: invited_lo
      time: '10:30'
    - session: __break
      time: '11:15'
    - session: invited_malavolta
      time: '11:45'
    - session: contributed1a
      time: '12:30'
    - session: __lunch
      time: '13:10'
    - session: contributed1b
      time: '14:40'
    - session: __break
      time: '16:00'
    - session: contributed1c
      time: '16:30'
    - session: __reception
      time: '19:00'

- day: '2024-09-03'
  sessions:
    - session: __updates&announcements
      time: '09:00'
    - session: tutorial_lukens
      time: '09:15'
    - session: invited_cao
      time: '10:30'
    - session: __break
      time: '11:15'
    - session: invited_brunner
      time: '11:45'
    - session: contributed2a
      time: '12:30'
    - session: __lunch
      time: '13:10'
    - session: contributed2b
      time: '14:40'
    - session: __break
      time: '16:00'
    - session: contributed2c
      time: '16:30'
    - session: poster
      time: '17:10'
    - session: _public_lecture
      time: '19:00'
    - session: __endofday
      time: '20:00'
```

The `session` field refers to the `.md` content file in `/YEAR/sessions/`.
The `time` field is the start time of the day.

> [!NOTE]
> When displaying a single session like [this one](https://qcrypt.net/2023/sessions/tutorial_yuen/), the start and end time are inferred from the schedule. In particular, the **end time** is the start time of the next event. Therefore, it's wise to include a `__endofday` event in the schedule of every day.


### Charter, History, Code of Conduct, other pages
just classic markdown files. 


### Blog (not used)
A blog should have these params:

```yaml
title: Title
brief: Short brief
image: /images/blog/photo.jpeg
date: 2019-01-20
draft: false
```

And of course, the body is the blog post.

## Debugging and Developing
Editing the theme can be tricky at times. 

### Which template?
Hugo's [template lookup order](https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order/) is not straightforward, so often it's not fully clear which template is actually used to display the current page. Therefore, when the local `hugo server` is run, some additional debug information is displayed on the page, often clarifying which template is used, and some additional information about the context.

This information is not displayed in a production environment, so don't worry about it.

```hugo
{{ if hugo.IsProduction | not }}
  <div style="background: #f0f0f0; padding: 10px; margin: 10px; font-family: monospace; font-size: 12px;">
    <details>
      <summary>Debug Info from baseof.html </summary>
      <pre>

```
